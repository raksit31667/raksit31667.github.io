Agile Tour BKK 2023

3 Centers
- Link to my old blog
- Head belief -> plan?, did we anticipate risk?, ROI?, data-driven
  - Head
    - Fear is not motivation -> don't use to drive to the goal
  - Heart
    - what is transformation? we should be proud of ourselves being waterfall
  - Body
    - We just simply don't know what to do, how to do it right
- Heart belief -> be agile, world class, professional, user-centric, if you are committed to the goal, everything will follow
  - Head
    - Risks? Worth?
  - Body
    - No! this is not tranformation
- Body belief -> can't explain much, example, just follow me
  - Head
    - Risks? Worth?
  - Heart
    - I wanna know the meaning of being Agile.
- Action items
  - Assess your own 3 centers (internal resources)
  - Ask yourself
    - What is the meaning of transforming from A to B?
    - What kind of uncertainty we might face in the future?
    - What do I need to do to kickstart transformation from A to B?
- Example: ceremonies
  - See photos in my mobile

Learning
- We rely on People team to support learning and development by guessing what employees need to learn. Eventually they will run out of ideas.
- Team members should have the authority to plan their own learning journey
- Know which skills we need to focus
  - They can use skill matrix to visualise -> comparing required skills with my skills
  - Most common tools, frequently used tech, common tech, team-specific skills, lib, frameworks
  - Build radar for skills that daily, weekly, rarely used
  - Use GitLab/GitHub
- Brachistochrone problem
  - Fastest way to learn is to connect subjects to relevant ones
  - Attach practices to the value those practices give
- Learn for knowledge, practice for skills
- SFIA

Exxon
- Start with culture change, then transform it later
- Adopt agile -> more visibility, more focus and priority, more alignment to business
- Q: Improve efficiency and effectivness -> What about employee satisfaction? -> team morale survey -> agile not related to employee satisfaction
- Don't hide problems
- Understand why you need to transform -> do not start transformation, re-organise, or think about scaling

Improvise
- Zoom (passing to others)
- Sync clapping
- Count 1-10
- Fail then celerate

Creating and sustaining high-performing teams
- High-performing = result x team member engagement
- Finding the right people is challenging
- In order to be sustainable, we need to pay attention to other dimensions (e.g., work is challenging)
- Agile is not designed for cost optimisation, but designed for building word-class products
- How to make high-performing
  - 10 things which require zero talent
  - Make the success of the team more important than what you will get out of your involvement
  - Make team members feel valued (kudos session, celebrating birthdays, welcoming new members)
- How to lead an outstanding team
  - Have a clear purpose and guiding principles
    - Think as an owner
    - Eat your own dog's food
    - Create and uphold a working agreement (what are the rules and behaviours we want to abide by in our team?)
    - SBI feedback
    - Use tools to deepen your self-awareness and your other-awareness
    - Book: Strength Finder
    - Create memorable experiences with the team
    - Create open communication
      - Radical Candor
      - Tuckman Revisited -> always in storming phase -> care each other more than win-lose

Transformation coaching
  - Coach starts from learning about coaching, mentoring, facilitating
  - In reality, coach is hired to get the job done -> lack confidence, some days I question if I provide any value.
  - Edge of Tomorrow -> learn by doing things repetitively
  - Learn from real-world constraints -> bring the whole team -> repetitive practice -> learning that sticks
  - Goals & Measures -> Bring Awareness -> Facilitate learning -> Empower
  - Example: 24 doors
    - Goal: Manage unplanned work better
    - Measure: 10% or less carryover
    - Bring awareness: multiple roles, unhealthy work intake, secret work
      - Ask
      - Share observations
      - Tools
      - Support the team for reflection & reframing
    - Coaching techniques: make everything visible, use house as a metaphor
    - Facilitate learning: 5 whys -> Unware of what we are doing as a whole, small group of decision makers
    - Empower team: Problems, Impacts, Goals, Solutions
  - Example: The black box
    - Goal: Reliable release schedule
    - Bring awareness: waste, lack of trust
    - Coaching techniques: value stream mapping
    - Facilitate learning: shared understanding on the whole release, flow efficiency
    - Empower team: understand the steps we rely on dependencies, explore options to reduce lead time
  - Example: Tuesday surprise
    - Goal: Reliable release schedule
    - Bring awareness: mutiple individual branches, merge on Tuesday, cherry pick on Wednesday
    - Coaching techniques: branching strategy
    - Facilitate learning: effective way to do branching
  - Q: What is the common anti-pattern of team in Dojo?
    - Team vs Group
    - Task breakdown
