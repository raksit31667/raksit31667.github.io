Non violent communication
- Pay attention to relationship and understand first
- The more we interpret, the more conflict it occurs
- Feeling != Thinking
- Need != How
- Individual should be responsible for their own needs
- It’s easier to request the right thing directly instead of saying Don’t to others, they might not get what you want
